Initialize Git repository with `git init` and create .gitignore file containing patterns for Rust, Node.js, and macOS\n2. Create Rust project using `cargo init --bin srcdumper`, then rename package to \"sourcedumper\" in Cargo.toml\n3.

Perform initial commit with all configuration files using message \"chore: initial project skeleton with Rust core\"\n6. Validate setup by building project with `cargo build` and optionally tag repository as v0.0.1-alpha\n\nKey Considerations:\n- Verify Rust installation via `rustc --version` before proceeding\n- Ensure Cargo.toml path matches workspace structure\n- Include required dependency placeholders for future HTTP/client functionality\n- Confirm .gitignore properly excludes target/ directories and OS-specific files\n</info added on 2025-07-14T17:12:04.632Z>",
