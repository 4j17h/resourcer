Perform initial commit with all configuration files using message \"chore: initial project skeleton with Rust core\"\n6. Validate setup by building project with `cargo build` and optionally tag repository as v0.0.1-alpha\n\nKey Considerations:\n- Verify Rust installation via `rustc --version` before proceeding\n- Ensure Cargo.toml path matches workspace structure\n- Include required dependency placeholders for future HTTP/client functionality\n- Confirm .gitignore properly excludes target/ directories and OS-specific files\n</info added on 2025-07-14T17:12:04.632Z>",

Benchmark before and after changes to quantify improvements (throughput, latency, memory usage).\n4. Validate output integrity after optimizations with regression tests.\n5.

Ensure the structure is logical and easy to understand.\n<info added on 2025-07-14T20:21:12.314Z>\nDesigning command structure:\n• Adopt clap subcommand model for clarity.\n• Primary subcommands:\n  1. list-urls   – Scan JS file/URL and output discovered sourcemap URLs.\n     Flags: --input <FILE>, --json\n  2. dump        – Full pipeline: fetch (or read), detect, download, reconstruct, output tree.\n     Flags: --url <URL>|--input <FILE>, --out <DIR>, --max-files, --max-bytes, --dry-run\n  3. browser     – SPA mode (headless; future task 9). Placeholder for now.\n  4. version     – Print version (handled by clap automatically but alias).\n• Global flags handled by clap (e.g., -v/--verbose later).\n\nImplementation approach:\n1. Modify crates/cli/src/main.rs to use top-level Cli with subcommands enum.\n2. Keep existing list-urls behaviour inside ListUrls subcommand.\n3. Other subcommands stub to println!(\"not implemented\") for now.\n4. Update Cargo dependencies remain the same.\n5. Ensure `cargo run -- list-urls --input foo.js` still works.\n\nNext: implement skeleton code + compile.\n</info added on 2025-07-14T20:21:12.314Z>",
